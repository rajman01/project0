                    One of my favourite thing to do is programming. I started learning computer programing late last year(2019),
                    I started learning with a programming language called python. My parents got me a laptop when i decided to
                    start computer programming, I wax very ecxited. i've learnt a few more languages after that. I started web 
                    development a few weeks back and it has been helpful all through. Now, I can already programue in python, C#, java
                    and HTML. I have done many projects. I hope that in the future I will get a job as a computer scientist.

                    I love them, i like their gerne of music, its  soul soothing. but I also like other groups like The Queens, The Baeatles
                    ,and many others.
